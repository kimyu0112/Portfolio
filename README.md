Design:
- One page design: I designed my portfolio and project page with the principle of "less is more" in mind. The main page is a long scrollable page, ensuring that all important information is readily accessible to the target audience without the need to click any buttons or links.

- Color theme: I chose green and light purple as my main color theme. Green is my favorite color and signifies nature, while light purple adds a calming and elegant touch. Overall, these two colors complement each other beautifully on a webpage and are pleasant to the eyes.

- The use of combination of pictures and text interspersed throughout the content adds visual interest and helps to break up the text, making it more engaging and less monotonous to read.

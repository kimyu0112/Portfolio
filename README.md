# Description of your portfolio website, including:
- Purpose:
  
I built my portfolio to attract potential employers who want to give aspiring web developers like me internship and experience.

- Functionality / features of my porfolio website
1. Bio/About Section:
   This section contains relevant highlights about my professional background, as well as my hobbies and personality traits that I believe can make me a likeable and hirable candidate. Additionally, there are buttons that allow viewers to easily access my portfolio and resume from the main page.

2. Relevant Skills:
   I have included skills such as HTML5, CSS3, React, JavaScript, and Git that I believe will be helpful in my hunt for an entry-level web developer role.

3. Personal Projects:
   This section showcases five of my projects to demonstrate my capabilities to potential employers.

4. Contact Information:
   Basic contact information, including my phone number, email, and address, is provided in this section. Additionally, I have incorporated a "Contact Me" form to make it easier for potential employers to reach out to me. The "Contact Me" form also enhances interactivity.
   
   Links to my social media profiles, such as GitHub and LinkedIn, are also included here. I believe that including relevant social media accounts can give potential employers a better understanding of my personality beyond the standard "About Me" section.

Design:
- One page design: I designed my portfolio and project page with the principle of "less is more" in mind. The main page is a long scrollable page, ensuring that all important information is readily accessible to the target audience without the need to click any buttons or links.

- Color theme: I chose green and light purple as my main color theme. Green is my favorite color and signifies nature, while light purple adds a calming and elegant touch. Overall, these two colors complement each other beautifully on a webpage and are pleasant to the eyes.

- The use of combination of pictures and text interspersed throughout the content adds visual interest and helps to break up the text, making it more engaging and less monotonous to read.

Tech Stack:
I have utilized HTML to define the structure and content of my portfolio. CSS has been employed to add styling and interactivity to enhance the user experience. Specifically, I have used Flexbox and Grid for creating responsive layouts, and I have incorporated media breakpoints extensively to ensure that my portfolio is visually appealing on various devices, including large monitors and small phone screens. Furthermore, I have deployed my website using Netlify, which allows me to easily publish updates directly from my Github repository.
